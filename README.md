**I build interfaces that demand attention.**  
From experimental stages to pixel-perfect production, I craft immersive, high-fidelity digital experiences for screens of every shape.

I‚Äôm a frontend engineer with a creative soul and a cinematic edge‚Äîdesigning UI that *feels* like something.

### CURRENTLY  
üõ† **Frontend Engineer** @ [Little Cinema Digital](https://lcdigital.io/)  
üéû Building web platforms that blend storytelling with interactivity.

We build virtual premieres for studios like HBO, Amazon, and Netflix‚Äîexperiences that blur the line between live broadcast and web technology. I help shape the frontend infrastructure behind it all, collaborating across disciplines to deliver real-time, high-pressure creative tools at scale.

### PHILOSOPHY  
I ship fast, obsess over the details, and write code that communicates.  
I believe frontend engineers are designers, too‚Äîand that great UX starts at the component level.

> I don‚Äôt just ‚Äúbuild pages‚Äù‚ÄîI construct moments, systems, tools, and emotional beats that move people. Whether it's a cinematic livestream experience or a modular editor for dynamic content, I think in **interaction**, not just layout.

---

### LOOKING AHEAD  
I'm currently exploring opportunities on web teams where **impact** beats process and **execution** trumps speculation.  
If you're building a platform that values velocity, expression, and bold UX thinking‚ÄîI‚Äôm listening.
